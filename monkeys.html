          <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
          <p>
            Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
            infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all
            animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys
            except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an
            incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes
            (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys and simians are synonyms. In
            1812, Étienne Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae
            group of monkeys together and established the name Catarrhini, "Old
            World monkeys" ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in French).[3][4][5] The
            extant sister of the Catarrhini in the monkey ("singes") group is
            the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).[3] Some nine million years
            before the divergence between the Cercopithecidae and the apes,[6]
            the Platyrrhini emerged within "monkeys" by migration to South
            America from Afro-Arabia (the Old World),[citation needed][7][8]
            likely by ocean.[9][10][better source needed] Apes are thus deep in
            the tree of extant and extinct monkeys, and any of the apes is
            distinctly closer related to the Cercopithecidae than the
            Platyrrhini are. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal),
            although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such
            as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal).
            Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the
            Old World monkeys. Within suborder Haplorhini, the simians are a
            sister group to the tarsiers – the two members diverged some 70
            million years ago.[11] New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys
            emerged within the simians roughly 35 million years ago. Old World
            monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine monkeys about 25
            million years ago. Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or
            Parapithecus (35–32 million years ago) are also considered monkeys
            by primatologists.
