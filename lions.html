          <h3>LIONS</h3>
          <p>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native
            to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested
            body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at
            the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are
            larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social
            species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a
            few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions
            usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large
            ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator. The lion
            inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more
            diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to
            being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period,
            the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe
            to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in
            sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been
            listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because
            populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since
            the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated
            protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully
            understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest
            causes for concern. One of the most widely recognised animal symbols
            in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in
            sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and
            films. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the
            Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in
            zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century.
            Cultural depictions of lions have occurred worldwide, particularly
            as a symbol of power and royalty.
