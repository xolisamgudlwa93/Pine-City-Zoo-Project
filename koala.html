          <h3>KOALA</h3>
          <p>
            The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called
            the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to
            Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family
            Phascolarctidae. Its closest living relatives are the wombats. The
            koala is found in coastal areas of the island's eastern and southern
            regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South
            Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and
            large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala
            has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg
            (8.8–33.1 lb). Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate
            brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller
            and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These
            populations are possibly separate subspecies, but not all
            researchers accept this. Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus
            woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet.
            This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and
            contains toxic compounds that deter most other mammals from feeding
            on them. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a
            day. They are asocial; only mothers bond to dependent offspring.
            Adult males communicate with bellows that intimidate rivals and
            attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent
            glands located on their chests. Like other marsupials, koalas give
            birth to young known as joeys at a very early stage of development.
            They crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they live for their
            first six to seven months. They are fully weaned around a year old.
            Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened
            by pathogens such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus.
            Because of their distinctive appearance, koalas, along with
            kangaroos, are recognised worldwide as symbols of Australia. They
            were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave
            art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European
            and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in
            1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the
            first detailed scientific description in 1814 although his work
            remained unpublished for 180 years. Artist John Gould illustrated
            and described the koala, thereby introducing the species to the
            British public. Further details about the animal's biology were
            revealed in the 19th century by English scientists. Koalas are
            listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for
            Conservation of Nature. Among the many threats to their existence
            are habitat destruction caused by agriculture, urbanisation,
            droughts, and associated bushfires, some related to climate change.
            In February 2022, the koala was officially listed as endangered in
            the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland.
